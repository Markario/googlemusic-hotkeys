# Google Music Hotkeys

Alfred 2.0 workflows and Applescripts to control Google Play Music

## Alfred 2.0

I've set the default hotkeys to F7, F8, and F9 for previous, play/pause, and
next track like on my Macbook. Use [KeyRemap4MacBook][] to remap the media
keys to the F-keys. Open Google Music with `gmusic` and search with `gmusic query`.

Requires the [Alfred Powerpack][]!

## Command Line (Applescript)

Comes with Google Chrome (but should work on safari, have not tested)
.
**Usage:** `./chrome.applescript ACTION`

**Actions:** `playPause`, `prevSong`, `nextSong`, `toggleShuffle`,
`toggleRepeat`.
